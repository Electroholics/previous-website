## About Us

ElectroHolics club is a dedicated group of hardware enthusiasts from IIIT-Delhi who believe in the ideology of learn, share and grow. We proposed this club to help people better understand the electronic gadgets that they use and also to provide them with a platform for their future projects and to develop their own devices. We believe if our fundamental concepts are strong then we can build anything from scratch. So lets join the league to foster our vision into reality.
