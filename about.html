## About

Thanks for dropping by. I hope that it will not waste your time, but in case it does, at least I tried.
Originally from Athens, Greece, I started my adventures in Computer Science and Technology from University of Athens where I received my Bachelor in Computer Science and Master in Software Engineering.
Between those, I spent a creative year in Geneva, Switzerland where I worked at CERN as a Computer Security researcher.
While attending my master's, I was working as a Machine Learning researcher for the <a href="http://kddlab.di.uoa.gr/" target="_blank">KDD</a> lab, supervised by <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PHJokEQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">Dimitrios Gunopulos</a>.
During my last summer break of my studies, I moved to Oslo, Norway, as an intern for Microsoft Development Center Norway.
That place won me and became my first working place in my post-academic life.

But, apart from being a <strike>cool guy</strike> geek,
I enjoy playing and composing music, messing with hardware, playing <a href="http://deck.tk/43TX9icn" target="_blank">card games</a>, yo-yoing and collecting comic books and vinyls.
In general, my mind can zone out during any form of creative act. Opinions expressed here are mine.
