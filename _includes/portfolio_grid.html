We proposed this club to help people better understand the electronic gadgets that they use and also to provide them with a platform for their future projects and to develop their own devices. We believe if our fundamental concepts are strong then we can build anything from scratch. So lets join the league to foster our vision into reality.

                You can contribute in two ways (i) share your technical knowledge by preparing handouts/lab experiments or lecture slides or by (ii) donating your spare hardware stuff which is getting coated in dust.
