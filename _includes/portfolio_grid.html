                 <p align="center">Electroholics club is a dedicated group<br> of hardware enthusiasts from IIIT-Delhi who believe in the <br>ideology of learn, share and grow. We proposed this club to <br>help people better understand the electronic gadgets that they use <br>and also to provide them with a platform for their future projects and to develop their own devices.<br> We believe if our fundamental concepts are strong then we can build anything from scratch.<br> So lets join the league to foster our vision into reality.</p>
